# Zulip Organization Name Change Script

This script allows you to alter the organization name on a Zulip server. It authenticates with the Zulip API, validates the current organization name, updates it to the new name, and attempts to rollback in case of any failure.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Zulip Python API client (`zulip`)
- A `zuliprc` configuration file for authentication

### Install Dependencies

Before running the script, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can install the Zulip Python API client using pip:

```bash
pip install zulip
```

### Setting Up the `zuliprc` File

Ensure you have a `zuliprc` file with the necessary credentials to authenticate with the Zulip API. The script uses this file to authenticate.

## Usage

To use the script, provide the current and new organization names as arguments:

```bash
python change_org_name.py <current_name> <new_name>
```

### Example

```bash
python change_org_name.py "Old Organization Name" "New Organization Name"
```

### Script Arguments

- `current_name`: The current name of the organization (as it exists on the Zulip server).
- `new_name`: The new name that you want to set for the organization.

### Logging

The script logs all actions and errors to a log file. The log file is created in the same directory where the script is executed, with the filename pattern `zulip_org_name_change_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`. The log includes timestamps for each log entry.

### Error Handling

- If the current organization name does not match the name on the server, the script will exit with an error.
- If the organization name update fails, the script will attempt to rollback to the previous organization name.
- The script logs any critical errors and exits if it cannot proceed due to an issue.

## Example Log Output

Example of what you might see in the log file:

```
2024-08-10 12:00:00 - INFO - Authenticating with Zulip API
2024-08-10 12:00:00 - INFO - Authentication successful
2024-08-10 12:00:00 - INFO - Fetching current organization name from server

2024-08-10 12:00:00 - INFO - Current organization name validated successfully
2024-08-10 12:00:01 - INFO - Attempting to update organization name to: New Organization Name
2024-08-10 12:00:02 - INFO - Organization name successfully updated to: New Organization Name
2024-08-10 12:00:02 - INFO - Script completed successfully. New organization name: New Organization Name
```

## Notes

- Ensure the `zuliprc` file is properly configured and placed in the expected path before running the script.
- The script is designed to work with the Zulip API. Ensure the Zulip server is accessible and that the API is enabled.
